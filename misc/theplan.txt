Cookie Clicker Game plan:

Task list (branches?)
    
    Create the Repo and clone it (so I have somewhere to save this file!)

    Create game wire frames:
        I plan of tackling the CSS last after I have a fully working game
        two wire frames mobile and desktop - desktop will be a centred version of the mobile (I will conquer CSS!)
        the mobile will have the cookie image in the center or to the right
        The number of cookies will be above the cookie image
        the cookies per second will be below the cookie image
        the upgrades will sit in a column to the left of the cookie image
        the upgrades will include a reset upgrade option

    Build the basic HTML structure:
        container holding; 
            image of the cookie that will be clicked
            text for the total number of clicks
            text for the 'cookie per second value'
            find and add an image for the cookie
        container to hold the upgrades;
            to be filled with buttons later including the reset option        

    Create function to update the game state - will be called by intervale timer
        for now just log to console
        later;
            add any update clicks
            update display 
            check score and enable upgrades as needed
            save gameState to local storage
        
    Create a game state object - Done
        to hold total clicks
        to hold clicks per second
        add loadState function?
        add saveState function?

    create a callback function for user mouse clicks
        adds 1 directly to the gameState
        directly updates the total clicks display            
    
    create a function intervalTimerStart()
        to handle the update activity
        create the interval timer and get it calling the update function
    call this function page load completed
        
    Create function to get the upgrade data from the API:
        first display it in the console
        then add a buttons to the upgrade container for each upgrade
        attach id's to each button to include clickrate modifier
        disable the button as default to be enabled by click update (when available)
    call this load function on page load completed
     
    Fight with the CSS demons into the late hours until it is defeated.


    
later thoughts:
function list:
updateGameState() called by interval times - for house keeping tasks
userMouseClick() called by the cookie image being clicked by user
initInterval() sets up and starts the interval timer called when page loadState
getUpgrades() calls the upgrades API to get all the upgrades, called when page loads

~ expect to need a getUpgradesComplete() function to be called when the promise is kept or broken - this was not needed its all builtin.

todo:
add persistence with local save - done
add proper init just having the calls at the bottom of the app.js feels wrong.  - done
add upgrade button that will reset the game
