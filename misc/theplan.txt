Cookie Clicker Game plan:

Task list (branches?)
    
    Create the Repo and clone it (so I have somewhere to save this file!

    Create game wire frames:
        I plan of tackling the CSS last after I have a fully working game
        two wire frames mobile and desktop - desktop will be a centred version of the mobile (I will conquer CSS!)
        the mobile will have the cookie image in the center or to the right
        The number of cookies will be above the cookie image
        the cookies per second will be below the cookie image
        the upgrades will sit in a column to the left of the cookie image
        the upgrades will include a reset upgrade option


    Build the basic HTML structure:
        container holding; 
            image of the cookie that will be clicked
            text for the total number of clicks
            text for the 'cookie per second value'
            find and add an image for the cookie
        container to hold the upgrades;
            to be filled with buttons later including the reset option        
    
    Get the cookie clicks working
        
        create a game state object
            to hold total clicks
            to hold clicks per second

        create a callback function
            this should update the total clicks
            later will update storage with the current game state 
        attach listener and call the callback on click
        
        update the total cookie clicks text
        
    create a function to handle the update activity
        create the interval timer and get it calling this function
        start this time on page load completed
    
    We should now have the basic working game without any upgrades
        
    Create function to get the upgrade data from the API:
        first display it in the console
        then add a button to the upgrade container for each upgrade    
        add call for it on page load completed
