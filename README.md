Create a cookie clicker game

Building the project, spent a time figuring out 'thePlan.txt' placed in the misc folder, this is my starting point to reference as I proceed, and as I get a little lost in details.

First up the wireframe:<br>
<img src="./misc/CookieClickerWireframe.png" width="400">

my plan is to use the same layout for desktop and center it on the screen, I need the CSS practice!
I will start with no styling and just get the game working, then add the styling.
